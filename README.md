# Jacobi-algorithm
-In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method (or Jacobi iterative method) is an algorithm for determining the solutions of a diagonally dominant* system of linear equations.
Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in
The process is then iterated until it converges.

-Diagonally dominant matrix if the magnitude of the diagonal entry in a row is larger than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of all the other (non-diagonal) entries in that row. 
|𝑎𝑖𝑗|≥ Σ|𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝑗 !=𝑖 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑖

-However a strictly dominant matrix if and only if the magnitude of the diagonal entry in a row is greater than the sum of the magnitudes of all the non-diagonal entries in that row.
|𝑎𝑖𝑗|> Σ|𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝑗 ≠ 𝑖 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑖
